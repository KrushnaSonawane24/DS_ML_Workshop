# DS_ML_Workshop
This project uses satellite images to extract NDVI, NDWI, BSI, and IOI indices. These indices help monitor vegetation, water, and soil conditions. Using Python, we plotted these values with trend lines to observe environmental changes over time. This analysis supports agriculture and climate monitoring using geographic data.
